            <li><strong>Be Kind to Yourself:</strong> Practice self-compassion. Don’t be too hard on yourself when things don’t go as planned. Treat yourself with the same kindness and care that you would show to a close friend.</li>
            <li><strong>Foster a Positive Environment:</strong> Surround yourself with positive, supportive people and create a living environment that promotes relaxation and happiness. Declutter your space and add comforting elements like plants, soft lighting, or soothing colors.</li>
            <li><strong>Get Regular Physical Exercise:</strong> Physical activity boosts mood, reduces stress, and improves overall mental health. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week.</li>
            <li><strong>Practice Mindfulness and Meditation:</strong> Engage in daily mindfulness activities, such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga. These practices help reduce stress and increase emotional resilience.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Informed About Mental Health:</strong> Educate yourself about mental health, including signs of stress, anxiety, and depression. Understanding your emotional state helps you recognize when to seek help or make changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Ensure Adequate Sleep:</strong> Prioritize getting 7-9 hours of restful sleep each night. Good sleep hygiene is crucial for emotional and cognitive functioning.</li>
